# Sign In Page

This is a simple and responsive Sign In page built with HTML5 and semantic tags for better accessibility and structure. It includes form fields for email, password, and a "Sign In with Google" button, along with options like "Remember me" and "Forgot your password?".

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The page is responsive and works well on all devices.
- **Semantic HTML**: The page uses semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to ensure the structure is clear and accessible.
- **FontAwesome Icons**: Google Sign In button includes an icon from FontAwesome.
- **Accessibility**: Form labels are properly associated with input fields using `id` and `for` attributes.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser that supports modern HTML5 standards.
- Internet connection for loading FontAwesome icons.
